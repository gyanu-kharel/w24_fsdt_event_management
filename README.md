# w24_fsdt_event_management

There has been some issue dockerizing the project. However the project can be run locally using docker.

1. Clone the repo
2. Open command prompt in base directory (where docker-compose.yaml is)
3. docker-compose build
4. docker-compose up

All the apps should run and can be seen in the docker desktop.
